Fishing around with code and geographic information

Life, love, and the pursuit of fish.  

My name is Ryan.  I am a simple person. I love to fish and I love my wife and dog. When I'm not outside pursuing my interests in the material world, I'm passionate about solving spatial problems and sharing spatial solutions with the digital world. I also, really, really, like to eat food.
